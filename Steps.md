# Things to keep in mind when selecting a device to install beta iOS software:

- The GM version of the OS refers to the version of the OS that has gone public. For example, iOS 9 GM refers to the last GM Seed that was approved by Apple for release to the public.
- Devices with an iOS beta installed may be restored to the current GM version of the OS, but they cannot be downgraded to the previous, non-beta, major OS version.
